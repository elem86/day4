# Day 4

🎯 Day 4 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🧩 Excel Chart race Part 1

📊 Today I began building an animated Olympic medal chart race in Excel — a challenging and fun data viz project.

✅ What I accomplished:

 - Created a cumulative medal count table by country and year

 - Built a scrollable bar chart that updates as you move through the timeline

 - Added scrollbar and macro buttons (macro in progress — full automation coming next!)

🎥 I recorded a short demo showing the chart updating as I manually scroll through the years. Even without automation, the interaction is already super satisfying.

🔧 Tomorrow: debug the macro to animate the chart automatically and smooth out the axis scaling.
